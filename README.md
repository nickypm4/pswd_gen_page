# HappyKey Password Generator ðŸ”‘âœ¨

Hey there! This is HappyKey, a simple and fast website that makes memorable passwords for you in the `adjective + noun + number` format. It's 100% private and I built it from scratch :)

## The Origin Story

For years, I've used passwords with the `adjective-noun-number` style because they're so easy to remember, but I started running out of good ideas.

So I looked online for a generator that used this specific format, and I was surprised that I couldn't find a simple, interactive one anywhere. Most were just static lists or generic random string generators.

So, I decided to make one myself! This project started as a simple command-line script and evolved into the full web app you see today. It was a super fun challenge and I learned a ton in the process.

## What It Does

*   âœ¨ **Completely Private:** The magic happens entirely in your browser. Nothing is ever saved, stored, or sent over the internet.
*   ðŸŽ¨ **Customizable:** Choose how many passwords to generate, and set your own minimum and maximum character lengths.
*   ðŸš€ **Instant Results:** Since there's no backend server, passwords are generated instantly.
*   ðŸ“± **Mobile Friendly:** The responsive design works great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## The Tech I Used

This site was built with the basics:
*   `HTML5`
*   `CSS3`
*   `Vanilla JavaScript` (No fancy frameworks!)

This was a really rewarding project that solved a real problem I had. Hope you find it useful too! :)
